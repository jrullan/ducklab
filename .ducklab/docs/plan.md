## M-001 — Reported bugs

### T-001 — Expose budget lifting through MCP and identify the invalid kind field in lift errors

Fixes B-004.

## Reported

What happened: both spec refresh runs (r-...-7s32, r-...-32gx) hit the default 3M token cap mid-council. run_get offered next: [resume, abort] — but resume continues the ledger from what was spent, so resuming without lifting the cap re-pauses immediately. The only lift door is POST /v1/runs/{id}/budget/lift over HTTP with the bearer token, which a remote MCP operator (Elena) cannot reach. A small operator obeying the offered actions enters resume→pause→resume forever.

Expected: the MCP surface closes the loop it opens — either a budget_lift tool (run_id, kind), or decide accepts a lift alongside resume ("resume with tokens uncapped"). Recorded like the desktop's lift: one-way, per-cap, attributed.

Related detail worth fixing in the same file: the lift endpoint's error for a wrong field names the valid VALUES ("no budget cap named ...") but not the FIELD (kind) — the artifact_read lesson applies (errors teach the field).

## Triage

**Component:** MCP budget controls

MCP offers resume for capped runs without exposing the required lift action, trapping remote operators in an endless pause-resume loop.

**Verification (triage recommends):** test-first — Pause a capped run, lift its budget through MCP, and verify resume proceeds; invalid lift fields should name kind.

### T-002 — Detect token repetition loops and apply contract-aware generation caps

Fixes B-007.

## Reported

What happened: during triage run r-20260815-003659-de7d, beelink-local entered a repetition loop while GENERATING its B-005 reply: the stream kept producing tokens for 6+ minutes while events.jsonl and llm.jsonl sat frozen — no tool call ever landed, so the repeat-call brake, gate brake and call caps saw nothing, and the stall watchdog stayed quiet because tokens WERE flowing. The human spotted it in the live stream; an events-based observer (me) verified the wrong layer and initially called it healthy. The duckling's max_tokens=20000 would have cut it eventually — but at local speeds that is ~10 minutes of wasted GPU per occurrence, and the loop landed as a truncated reply, not as a diagnosed loop.

Expected, in small-seat-first order: (a) contract-aware output caps — a json:triage reply is a classification and should cap around 2k tokens, a spec draft legitimately needs 20k; one blanket per-duckling max_tokens cannot serve both; (b) a stream repetition detector (n-gram window over deltas) that cuts the call, records a repetition_loop event, and retries once with the loop named in the prompt; (c) the run view should surface tokens-flowing-but-nothing-landing as its own signal — the human should not be the only detector with eyes on that layer.

## Triage

**Component:** LLM generation streaming

A token-level loop consumes substantial GPU time while bypassing existing brakes and produces a misleading truncated reply.

**Verification (triage recommends):** test-first — Stream repeated n-grams during a JSON triage response and expect a repetition_loop event, cancellation, and one retry with the loop named.

### T-003 — Always include next_steps in MCP status response, even when empty

Fixes B-002.

## Reported

What happened: the status tool's description instructs the agent "When the human asks what to do, answer FROM next_steps: it already knows that a triaged bug wants promoting and which task is buildable" — but the response objects carry only name/project/running/waiting_for_decision. No next_steps field arrives, for any project (observed against three projects, one with a pending gate).

Expected: each project in the status response carries next_steps (the same ProjectNext the desktop's guide rail shows), or the tool description stops promising it. An agent operator (Elena) told to answer FROM a field that never arrives either invents guidance or goes silent.

## Triage

**Component:** mcp
**Suspected files:** internal/mcp/tools.go

The status() function conditionally omits next_steps when ProjectNext returns empty, contradicting the tool description that promises it for every project.

**Verification (triage recommends):** test-first — MCP status tool response must include next_steps field for every project, even when empty

### T-004 — Add per-project document lifecycle state to MCP status response

Fixes B-003.

## Reported

What happened: driving the ducklab adopt via MCP, there was no way to learn which lifecycle documents exist and whether they are approved. status doesn't say; the only discovery paths were (a) colliding with stage_start errors ("this project already has requirements") and (b) artifact_get, which returns the ENTIRE document — the ducklab spec is ~15k tokens, fatal context spend for a small local operator (pato-atom, 32k) that only needed "does it exist? approved?".

Expected: a cheap orientation surface — either status gains per-project document state (requirements: approved, spec: approved, plan: none, tasks: N, open bugs: N), or artifact_get grows a summary mode (ids + titles + approved flag, no bodies). The error-message teaching is excellent (it names the right next door) but discovery-by-collision costs a failed call and a confused operator.

## Triage

**Component:** mcp
**Suspected files:** internal/mcp/mcp.go

MCP status lacks document lifecycle state, forcing agents to pay for full documents via artifact_get or collide with stage_start errors

**Verification (triage recommends):** test-first — MCP status tool should return per-project document lifecycle state (requirements/spec/plan status, task count, bug count) without requiring artifact_get
